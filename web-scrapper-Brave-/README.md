# web-scrapper-Brave-
A beginner python web scrapper for downloading pictures from google.

>**Intro** 

This is a web scrapper built in python for brave (chromium core-95) for google images.<br>
You have to enter the google page from where you want to download (working on making it compatible with other websites).<br>
This is a very rudimentry project, nothing fancy.<br>
My first repo too (:

>**chrome-driver**

I have used -95.<br>
https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=95.0.4638.69/ <br>
find the one compatible with yours from.<br>
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

*I was using brave so I had to set the binary you will find it in the code.*

>**py Libraries used**

Pillow <br> 
Selenium <br>
