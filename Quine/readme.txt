QUINE

>> q.cpp
Uses the escaper.cpp helper to generate a formatted string output of the source code(with ? as the anchor) of the program. The output is then used within the code to represent the source code. The following logic then uses the `?` as an anchor or trigger, to switch from printing to escape printing(prints with escaped literals).

>> q.py
One liner python quine

Usage

$ make escaper
# copy the output and replace the s var with the it
$ make
